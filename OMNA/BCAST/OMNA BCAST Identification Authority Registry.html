     <p>OMNA maintains this registry for Identification Authority associated with BCAST services. </p>
     <p>
        The Identification Authority label follow a simple naming model that permits unambiguous usage. Each Identification Authority label is structured as a URN to assure uniqueness. The model follows the following grammar: 
     </p>
     <p class="quote">{IdentAuthLabel} ::= urn:oma:bcast:iauth:{IAiD} </p>
     </br>Where
     <p class="quote">- {IAiD} is a string that is registered to a BCAST Identification Authority (see table below) </p>
     </br>Notes:
     <ul>
        <li>1.<i> {IAiD}</i> patterns starting with 'x-' are for testing and need not be coordinated with OMNA as they will not be recorded </li>
        <li>2. <em>{IAiD} </em>patterns starting with 'dns-' are an alternative to registration when the text following the 'dns-' is a legitimate domain name string. As an alternative to registration, such strings need not be requested by OMNA, nor will they be recorded. </li>
     </ul>
