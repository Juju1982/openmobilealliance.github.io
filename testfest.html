                                which allow OMA Members and Non-Members to test their implementations, based on OMA enablers, 
                                in a confidential setting. You can read more in depth about TestFest events on the OMA TestFest Overview page.

                                OMA TestFests events are designed to verify the quality of OMA specifications and enable vendors to verify and test the interoperability of their product implementations.
                                There are one to three TestFest events per year and these events are hosted in a variety of locations and settings throughout the world. Sometimes, 
                                TestFest events are held at venues in conjunction with OMA member meetings. Other times, OMA member companies offer to host in their own facilities. The information below is provided to help potential TestFest Hosts determine if they are able to accommodate a TestFest event:

                                    Different web-enabled devices have different input, output, hardware, software, network and browser capabilities. In order for a web server or web-based application
                                    to provide optimized content to different clients it requires a description of the capabilities of the client known as the delivery context. Recently two new compatible standards have been created for
                                    describing delivery context: Composite Capabilities / Preferences Profile (CC/PP) created by the W3C and User Agent Profile (UAProf) created by the WAP Forum.
